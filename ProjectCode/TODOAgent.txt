+ Change how activities are chosen
- Change how totalWaste to collect for contracts is made to take into account factorWaste for households
- Change hardcoded population spread to use config.json

- Take into account efficiency of recycling from recycling companies 
	- companies need to have an efficiency (how much raw plastic they obtain from the waste collected)
	- companies have money to invest in new technologies that improve their efficiency

- Instant rate needs to take into account the fact that people can produce less plastic waste as a % of total waste over time because of activities

- Every 5 years increase taxes on plastics

- Change values of activites cost and build more centralized collection spots

- Change values in config.json to be more accurate
